This a collection of examples of how to use Greta!

#What is Greta
Greta decentralizes data distribution, just as internet was once intended. Smarter for users, smarter for distributors.

Internet is rapidly expanding, with heavy data that needs to be distributed between billions of people, devices, houses, streets and vehicles in all parts of the world.

By making data distribution easy and accessible to anyone, we intend to keep internet the home of new ideas and equal opportunities.

Use Greta by simply including the standard script or customize after your specific needs.

#How to run examples
You will need a web server running on your local machine or a server to make the examples work.

This is because some of the Javascript functions used is not allowed on file:// So you will need to access them over http:// or https://

If you have a web server running just make sure to put the examples in the right directory or point the server to the right place.

If you do not have a web sever running we have put together some examples to get you started.
